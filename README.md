Things I set out to accomplish with this course:

- [ ] Solutions that don't take 10k lines of code
- [ ] How to get the player "in a vehicle" with a camera system that makes sense
- [ ] And making an actual project with a player that has a gun
- [ ] How to publish the game to Steam and Itch.io
- [ ] Saving game state

With these core essentials I think I could can make almost any game imaginable.

It should be noted that this course is 100% free and open source. That means that when you finish this course, if you find a typo or want to improve it for others who will come after you, then you absolutely can!

All contributions are welcome and I sincerely hope you can find this useful.

Some people on the internet (mainly youtube) have already made amazing tutorials and videos, and I don't think it makes sense to just remake those videos myself so instead I've simply used their video in place of my own. Feel free to subscribe to them if you find their videos useful.

And with that I hope you enjoy this course!
